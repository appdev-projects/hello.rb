# hello.rb

To create a Gitpod workspace based on this repository, paste this URL into your address bar:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appdev-projects/hello.rb

You might want to Fork (copy) the repository to your own account first, if you plan to make changes to the code that you want to save. (You don't have permission to push changes back to my repo.) Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repo's page, if so.

You can install [Gitpod's browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/20_browser_extension/) to add a button to your browser that will create a workspace based on any repository you are looking at, if you want to.
